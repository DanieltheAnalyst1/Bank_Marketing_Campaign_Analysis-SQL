# ðŸ“Š Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis: Uncovering What Works

In this project, I analyzed data from a bankâ€™s marketing campaigns to reveal what drives customer engagement. Through a series of SQL queries, I explored patterns in demographics, behaviors, and previous responses to better understand whoâ€™s saying "yes" to a deposit. Each analysis here provides insights to guide future strategies, targeting the right people with the right messages.

## Key Insights and Visuals

### 1. Total Successful Deposits
My first step was to count how many customers made deposits. This serves as the foundationâ€”understanding the overall response helps measure the success of other strategies.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_deposits
FROM bank
WHERE deposit = 'yes';
```

**Takeaway:** This count serves as a baseline for all other comparisons, helping me gauge what drives these deposit decisions.

### 2. Deposits by Job Type
Next, I looked at the impact of job roles on deposits. Knowing which sectors engage more can shape targeted strategies.

```sql
SELECT job, COUNT(*) AS deposits
FROM bank
WHERE deposit = 'yes'
GROUP BY job
ORDER BY deposits DESC;
```

**Takeaway:** Some job roles show significantly higher engagement. This insight enables the bank to personalize messages, ensuring outreach is relevant to specific occupations.

### 3. Deposits by Education Level
I also analyzed deposit trends across educational backgrounds to see if this factor plays a role in customer engagement.

```sql
SELECT education, COUNT(*) AS deposits
FROM bank
WHERE deposit = 'yes'
GROUP BY education
ORDER BY deposits DESC;
```

### 4. Deposits by Marital Status
Understanding how marital status impacts deposit rates provides a glimpse into customer priorities based on life stages.

```sql
SELECT marital, COUNT(*) AS deposits
FROM bank
WHERE deposit = 'yes'
GROUP BY marital
ORDER BY deposits DESC;
```
